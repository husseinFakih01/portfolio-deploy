                    Hello, My name is Hussein Fakih, and I'm currently a senior majoring in computer science at Wayne State University in Detroit. 
                    Iâ€™ve taken many classes such as(software Engineering, Web Development, DataBase Managment..) and had an internship as a Web Developer that solidified my passion for computer science, and helped me become a quick and adaptable learner.
